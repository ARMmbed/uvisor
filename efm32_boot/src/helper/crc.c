 * @brief
 *   This function calculates the CRC-16-CCIT checksum of a memory range.
 *
 * @note
 *   This implementation uses an initial value of 0, while some implementations
 *   of CRC-16-CCIT uses an initial value of 0xFFFF. If you wish to
 *   precalculate the CRC before uploading the binary to the bootloader you
 *   can use this function. However, keep in mind that the 'v' and 'c' commands
 *   computes the crc of the entire flash, so any bytes not used by your
 *   application will have the value 0xFF.
 *
 * @param start
 *   Pointer to the start of the memory block
 *
 * @param end
 *   Pointer to the end of the block. This byte is not included in the computed
 *   CRC.
 *
 * @return
 *   The computed CRC value.
