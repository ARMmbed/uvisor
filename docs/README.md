# The uVisor Documentation

The uVisor documentation is divided into two areas, depending on what your interest. These domains are described below. If you instead are interested in the general uVisor design philosophy, you can see our [high level introduction to mbed uVisor](https://github.com/ARMmbed/uvisor/raw/docs/uVisorSecurity-TechCon2016.pdf) or refer to the uVisor [GitHub documentation](../README.md).

## API documentation

These are the user-facing documents. They are the ideal starting point to know what you can do with uVisor, and how to setup an application to use the uVisor features.
